# RealWorld Health Frontend

## Homepage

For the main features of the site you'll have to create an account and be logged in. Luckily enough we make it easy to do this!

When you get to our homepage (https://kainanh.github.io/realworldhealth/), this is what you'll see.

When on the login page type in the username and password you used to create your account and if you typed everything in correctly you'll be logged in and taken to the dashboard. If you dont yet have an account, you can click on the link beneath the log in form which will allow you to create an account.

Alternatively if you have already made an account but you've forgotten your password, you can click on the forgotten password link which will present a password recovery form.

### Creating an account

When creating an account you'll have to make sure you enter a email, and a password that's long enough, including a capital letter and a special character (as well as confirming that password just to make sure you know what you typed!). Otherwise you'll get an error message and see something like this

Don't worry if this happens to you, you can easily try again.

If you successfully create an account you'll see a little success message and be redirected to the login page soon after.

### Dashboard

Once successfully logged in, you will be redirected to the dashboard page. Here you are able to visualise the qliksense dashboard within an iframe.

Here you also see the header for the first time which you'll have access to. By clicking on the small icon in the top right a drop down menu will appear and look something like this:

By clicking Log out, your account will be logged out ending your session and returning you to the homepage.
